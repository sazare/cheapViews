I clearfed the concepts about substitution-apply-unify.

1. Substitution(Σ) can have {x<-f(x)}
   Σ=VxT

2. apply(α) replaces a var with the corresponding term simulteniously.
   Because it, the substituion can be express unambiguously as 
    (v1,v2,v3) <- (t1,2,t3) without {}

   α: T x Σ → T
   α: Σ x Σ → Σ 

3. <x:f(x)> fails. It is caused by inside check.
   This doesn't except x<-f(x) from substitution.

   <> : T x T → Σ

I thought yesterday, this is not correctly implemented now.
But today reso.jl should be correct. 
I clearfy some tests around this.
