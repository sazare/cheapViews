@ test of evaluation dont work
# intended 2 proofs

[x,z].[-Z(55,z)]
 [x,z].[-Z(x,z)]

!ge(x,y) = x>=y
!lt(x,y) = x<y

[x,z].[+Z(x,z),-R(x,z),-ge(x,0)]
[x,z].[+Z(x,z),-R(x,z),-lt(x,0)]
 [x,z].[+Z(x,f(z)),-R(x,z),-ge(x,0)]
[].[+R(55,20)]
[].[+R(-23,10)]

# ->=(x,y) is inhivitable in Julia
# in Expr, >=, < become infix. so, rename it.


## this direction is bad!!
